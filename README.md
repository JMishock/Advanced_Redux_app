Advanced Redux App

This application is part of a Udemy.com course React-The Complete Guide(incl Hooks, React Router, Redux) 
by Maximilian Schwarzmuller.

This application is more advanced in that the user can order multiple books which are then tallied into a cart.
The user can chose to buy a book titled "My First Book" for $6.00 each.
The user may also select to buy a second book titled "My Second Book" for $5.00.
The user can add the book to the cart by hovering over the "Add to cart" button which will turn aqua in color.
For every book added to the cart, the "My Cart" button in the top right will increase by 1.
Hovering over this button will turn it blue.
Inside the "My Cart" modal displays how many of each book were added to the cart with the price total displayed in two seperate boxes
(one for each book) as well as how much each book costs individually.
The user may add or remove additional books in this section by selecting the - or + button.


This was a more advanced application to create as it creates a list of however many books you want to sell or buy, as well as changing color animations when hovering over or selecting a button. It also added a cart and features such as - and + that add and remove books from the cart as well as an up-to-date counter that displays how many books are in the users cart at any given time.
This was a great learning and challenging application that can be implimented as a template for shopping websites.


Running the attached code You can use the attached code simply to compare it to yours. But you can also run it. To run my code, navigate into a specific code snapshot folder via the cd command in your command prompt or terminal first. Then run npm install to install all required dependencies (this will create a /node_modules folder). Run npm start to pull up application on your computer. Important: You always download the entire branch content!

Important: If you're using the code for a module that requires API keys or a backend (e.g. the module about sending Http requests), you'll have to use your backend URLs or API keys. Mine won't work (I disabled my projects)
